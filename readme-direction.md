# Invokes an LLM as part of its functionality

- This will make a call to an llm to summarize the chats, and give context

# If you build it you will be able to deploy it
- Yes we can use vercel for the front end deployment site, Supabase or AWS for the backend, and Vercel for the domain deployment
