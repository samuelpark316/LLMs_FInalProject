## How to Use

### Opening Search
1. Click the search bar in the header
2. Press **âŒ˜K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows)

### Searching
1. Type your query in the search field
2. Results appear instantly
3. Search queries match:
   - Message content (case-insensitive)
   - User names

### Filtering Results
1. **By User**: Select a user from "From" dropdown
2. **By Channel**: Select a channel/DM from "In" dropdown
3. **By Recency**: Choose sort order from "Sort" dropdown
4. Click "Clear filters" to reset all filters

### Viewing Results
- Click any result to navigate to that channel/DM
- Search terms are highlighted in yellow
- See context (channel name) for each result

### Closing Search
- Press **ESC**
- Click the X button in the top right

## Technical Implementation

### Search Algorithm
```typescript
1. Filter messages by query (content or user name)
2. Apply "From" filter if specified
3. Apply "In" filter if specified
4. Sort results:
   - Relevant: Exact matches first, then by recency
   - Newest: Descending timestamp
   - Oldest: Ascending timestamp
```

### Performance
- 300ms debounce on search input
- Simulated 500ms API delay for realism
- Efficient filtering using array methods
- React optimizations with proper dependencies

### Text Highlighting
- Uses regex to split text into parts
- Wraps matching text in styled spans
- Case-insensitive matching
- Preserves original text casing
