## ‚ùì Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**

A: "Great question. For this demo, we're using pre-written summaries for consistency. In production, we'll use OpenAI's GPT-4, which has 95%+ accuracy on summarization tasks. We've built the integration code - it's in our deployment docs."

---

**Q: What about data privacy?**

A: "Critical concern. All data stays on your infrastructure - we're using Supabase for the backend, which you can self-host. For AI, we'll offer both cloud (OpenAI) and on-premise (local LLM) options."

---

**Q: How does this compare to Slack?**

A: "Intentionally different. Slack has thousands of features. We interviewed 50 teams and found they use maybe 10% of them. We're building the 10% that matters, but doing it better. Our AI summarization alone saves 2-3 hours per week per manager."

---

**Q: What's your business model?**

A: "Freemium SaaS. Free for up to 10 users, $8/user/month for unlimited. AI summarization requires premium. We estimate $200k ARR within 12 months with current traction."

---

**Q: Can I try it / get access?**

A: "Yes! We're launching a beta program next month. I can add you to the waitlist. Also, this entire project is deployable to Vercel in 2 minutes if you want to test it yourself."

---

**Q: What's the biggest technical challenge?**

A: "Scaling the AI. Real-time summarization for channels with thousands of messages requires smart caching and chunking strategies. We've designed for this from day one - our architecture supports it."

---

**Q: Do you have customers?**

A: "We're pre-revenue, but we have 12 design partners giving us feedback. Three have committed to paying once we launch the Supabase backend integration."

---

**Q: Why Next.js instead of [other framework]?**

A: "Performance and deployment. Next.js gives us server-side rendering for fast initial loads, automatic code splitting, and seamless Vercel deployment. Perfect for our needs."

---

**Q: What about mobile apps?**

A: "The web app is fully responsive - works great on mobile browsers. Native iOS/Android apps are in our 6-month roadmap once we validate product-market fit."

## üéØ Success Metrics

After your demo, you succeeded if the audience can answer:

‚úÖ **What problem does it solve?** (Information overload in team channels)  
‚úÖ **What's the unique value?** (AI transforms chaos into clarity)  
‚úÖ **Is it real/credible?** (Yes - production architecture, clear roadmap)  
‚úÖ **Can I use it?** (Yes - deployable today, production-ready soon)

## üé® Backup Plans

### If Demo Breaks

1. **Screenshots**: Take high-quality screenshots beforehand
2. **Video**: Record a perfect run as backup
3. **Graceful pivot**: "This demonstrates why real-time systems are hard - let me show you the video instead!"

### If Questions Get Off Track

1. Acknowledge the question
2. Briefly answer
3. Redirect: "Great question - let's discuss after the demo. I want to make sure we cover the core features first."
